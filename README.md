> A project combining React, Mantine UI, and Tailwind CSS for building modern web applications.

## ✨ Features

* **Modern UI Framework:** Built using React (v19) for a component-driven, declarative interface.
* **Rich Component Library:** Integrates with Mantine UI (`@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks`) providing pre-built UI elements and utility hooks.
* **Utility-First Styling:** Employs Tailwind CSS along with `@tailwindcss/postcss`, enabling flexible and rapid styling while maintaining consistency.
* **PostCSS Integration:** Leverages PostCSS plugins like `postcss-import`, `autoprefixer`, and `postcss-simple-vars` for advanced CSS processing.
* **Type Safety:** Utilizes TypeScript (v5.8.x) to enhance code reliability and provide robust type checking during development.
* **Fast Development Workflow:** Uses Rsbuild (`@rsbuild/core` and `@rsbuild/plugin-react`) for optimized builds and efficient development server performance.
* **Icon Support:** Includes `@iconify/json` and `@iconify/tailwind` for scalable and customizable iconography.
* **Consistent Design Language:** Combines `postcss-preset-mantine` and `tailwind-preset-mantine` for seamless integration between Mantine and Tailwind styles.
* **Focus on Code Quality:** Includes ESLint with `@antfu/eslint-config` for linting and enforcing best practices in the codebase.
