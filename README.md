> A React project utilizing Mantine and Tailwind CSS for building modern, responsive user interfaces.

## ✨ Features

- Modern UI Framework: Built using React (v19.x) for a component-driven architecture and rich interactivity.
- Rich Component Library: Integrates with Mantine (`@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks`) for pre-built, customizable UI components and hooks.
- Utility-First Styling: Employs Tailwind CSS for flexible, rapid styling and theming.
- Type Safety: Leverages TypeScript to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors.
- Fast Development Workflow: Utilizes Rsbuild for quick server starts, optimized builds, and hot module replacement.
- Responsive Design Support: Likely incorporates Tailwind’s responsive utilities alongside Mantine’s adaptive components for a seamless mobile-first experience.
- Focus on Code Quality: Includes ESLint with Antfu’s configuration for consistent coding standards and error prevention.
- Customizable Theming: Potentially offers theme customization via Mantine and Tailwind CSS presets, allowing developers to tailor the UI to their needs.
